in console it work very well when i click on the remove button but in dom the child is not remove 
it take me much more to solve .

.when i refresh the dom the dada is also not there in dom as well as local storage

<!-- solution -->
to solution for i need to get data from the local storage and save into that array and update it 
when the array update the dome also update withoute loss any data 

and i need to give an unique key to every task div .wheni click on the remove button filter method return array which is not equal to that paticulater  id .and update the the localcal storage again and also updatethe existing array

<!-- bassically  -->
 dom manupulation take much more time
